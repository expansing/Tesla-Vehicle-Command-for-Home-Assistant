# Tesla Vehicle Command

Home Assistant custom integration that receives Tesla vehicle state through Fleet Telemetry and sends signed commands through the Tesla Fleet API.

Tesla command authentication has four distinct parts:

1. Tesla OAuth lets Home Assistant access the account.
2. Tesla partner registration associates the Tesla developer app with a public domain and public command key.
3. A command key pair lets a vehicle authenticate commands end to end.
4. Tesla's `tesla-http-proxy` converts the Fleet API calls made by this integration into authenticated vehicle commands.

This guide configures all four parts using the Home Assistant Add-on Store, a minimal public-key server, and Cloudflare Tunnel. Replace every value in angle brackets with values from your own deployment.

## Before You Begin

You need:

- Home Assistant OS or Supervised, with access to a Terminal/SSH add-on.
- A Tesla account and an eligible Tesla vehicle.
- A Tesla Developer account at <https://developer.tesla.com>.
- A domain managed by Cloudflare.
- An HTTPS external URL for Home Assistant, such as `https://<ha-hostname>.<your-domain>`.
- A second hostname dedicated to Tesla's public key, such as `https://<tesla-key-hostname>.<your-domain>`.
- Cloudflare Tunnel connected to the Home Assistant network.

Do not reuse the Home Assistant hostname as the Tesla key hostname. The Tesla key endpoint must be public and unauthenticated, while Home Assistant should retain its normal authentication.

## Security Model

Only one file is public: the command **public** key at Tesla's required `.well-known` URL. It cannot be used to control a vehicle.

Never publish, upload, or paste a command **private** key, Tesla Client Secret, OAuth token, or Home Assistant configuration directory into a web server, Cloudflare Tunnel configuration, Git repository, issue report, or chat.

The local command proxy has no published host port. Do not add it to Cloudflare Tunnel or configure router port forwarding for it.

## 1. Create the Tesla Developer App

1. Open <https://developer.tesla.com> and create an **App**.
2. Add this redirect URI exactly:

   ```text
   https://<ha-hostname>.<your-domain>/auth/external/callback
   ```

3. Add this allowed origin exactly:

   ```text
   https://<tesla-key-hostname>.<your-domain>
   ```

4. Enable these scopes:

   ```text
   openid
   offline_access
   vehicle_device_data
   vehicle_cmds
   vehicle_charging_cmds
  vehicle_location
   ```

5. Save the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. They are entered into Home Assistant later.

The redirect URI and allowed origin are separate values. The redirect URI points to Home Assistant; the allowed origin matches the public-key hostname exactly.

## 2. Generate the Command Key Pair

Run these commands in the Home Assistant Terminal/SSH add-on. They generate a NIST P-256 key pair compatible with Tesla vehicle command authentication.

```sh
mkdir -p /config/tesla_vehicle_command/keys /config/tesla_public
chmod 700 /config/tesla_vehicle_command/keys

openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout \
  -out /config/tesla_vehicle_command/keys/tesla-command-private-key.pem
openssl ec -in /config/tesla_vehicle_command/keys/tesla-command-private-key.pem \
  -pubout \
  -out /config/tesla_public/com.tesla.3p.public-key.pem

chmod 600 /config/tesla_vehicle_command/keys/tesla-command-private-key.pem
chmod 755 /config/tesla_public
chmod 644 /config/tesla_public/com.tesla.3p.public-key.pem
```

The files have different purposes:

```text
/config/tesla_vehicle_command/keys/tesla-command-private-key.pem  Secret; import into the integration.
/config/tesla_public/com.tesla.3p.public-key.pem                  Public; serve this one file to Tesla.
```

Show the public PEM that Nginx will serve. Do not print, paste, or share the private PEM:

```sh
cat /config/tesla_public/com.tesla.3p.public-key.pem
```

Check that the hosted public PEM was derived from the private key without showing private-key material:

```sh
openssl ec -in /config/tesla_vehicle_command/keys/tesla-command-private-key.pem \
  -pubout \
  | diff - /config/tesla_public/com.tesla.3p.public-key.pem
```

`diff` returns no output when the public keys match.

Do not generate another key later. The public key hosted for Tesla, the private key imported into Home Assistant, and the key paired with the vehicle must all be the same key pair.

## 3. Add the Packaged Add-ons

This repository is both a HACS integration repository and a Home Assistant add-on repository. In Home Assistant, open **Settings > Add-ons > Add-on store**, select the overflow menu, then choose **Repositories**. Add:

```text
https://github.com/expansing/tesla_vehicle_command
```

After the repository loads, install these add-ons from the Add-on Store and enable **Start on boot**:

1. **Tesla Public Key Server**
2. **Tesla Vehicle Command Proxy**
3. **Tesla Fleet Telemetry Receiver** (only when enabling telemetry in step 9)

Start the public-key server after the command key from step 2 exists. It serves only `/config/tesla_public/com.tesla.3p.public-key.pem`; no add-on files need to be copied or created manually.

Confirm the server exposes only the intended public key:

```sh
curl -i http://<home-assistant-lan-ip>:8099/.well-known/appspecific/com.tesla.3p.public-key.pem
curl -i http://<home-assistant-lan-ip>:8099/
```

The first response must be `200` and start with `-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----`. The second response must be `404`.

## 4. Route the Key Server Through Cloudflare Tunnel

In Cloudflare Zero Trust:

1. Go to **Networks > Tunnels** and select the tunnel that can reach the Home Assistant network.
2. Add a public hostname: `<tesla-key-hostname>.<your-domain>`.
3. Set service type to `HTTP`.
4. Set the service URL to:

   ```text
   http://<home-assistant-lan-ip>:8099
   ```

   Use the Home Assistant host's LAN address. `localhost` works only when `cloudflared` runs in the same network namespace as the Nginx server.

5. Do not configure Cloudflare Access, login, redirects, or any authentication policy for this hostname.

Verify from outside the home network, for example using mobile data:

```sh
curl -i --max-time 10 \
  https://<tesla-key-hostname>.<your-domain>/.well-known/appspecific/com.tesla.3p.public-key.pem
```

It must return the public PEM directly with HTTP `200`. A Cloudflare error page, `524` timeout, redirect, or login page will prevent Tesla registration and vehicle pairing.

## 5. Register the Tesla Partner Account

Tesla Fleet API partner registration is regional. Use the region associated with your Tesla account:

```text
Europe:        https://fleet-api.prd.eu.vn.cloud.tesla.com
North America: https://fleet-api.prd.na.vn.cloud.tesla.com
```

Obtain a partner token in a trusted terminal. Set `FLEET_API_BASE_URL` to the regional endpoint selected above.

```sh
CLIENT_ID='<Tesla Client ID>'
CLIENT_SECRET='<Tesla Client Secret>'
FLEET_API_BASE_URL='https://fleet-api.prd.eu.vn.cloud.tesla.com'

PARTNER_TOKEN="$(
  curl -sS --request POST \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
    --data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials' \
    --data-urlencode "client_id=$CLIENT_ID" \
    --data-urlencode "client_secret=$CLIENT_SECRET" \
    --data-urlencode 'scope=openid vehicle_device_data vehicle_cmds vehicle_charging_cmds' \
    --data-urlencode "audience=$FLEET_API_BASE_URL" \
    'https://fleet-auth.prd.vn.cloud.tesla.com/oauth2/v3/token' \
  | jq -r '.access_token'
)"
```

Register the public-key hostname. Do not include `https://` or a path.

```sh
curl -i --request POST \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $PARTNER_TOKEN" \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"domain":"<tesla-key-hostname>.<your-domain>"}' \
  "$FLEET_API_BASE_URL/api/1/partner_accounts"
```

Tesla must be able to retrieve the public key from the hostname during registration. Keep the key service available permanently: Tesla may retrieve it again for key pairing or command validation.

## 6. Start the Tesla Vehicle Command Proxy

Start **Tesla Vehicle Command Proxy** from the Add-on Store after installing it in step 3. It runs Tesla's official `tesla/vehicle-command` image and needs no configuration.

The first log messages may say:

```text
Waiting for Tesla Vehicle Command integration files...
```

This is expected until the integration writes its local TLS material and command-key copy. The add-on is internal only. Never expose port `4443` through Cloudflare Tunnel, a reverse proxy, or router port forwarding.

## 7. Install and Configure the Integration

### Install

Install through HACS using this repository. HACS installs the integration only; the three add-ons are installed separately from the Add-on Store in step 3.

For unsupported manual installation, copy the integration files to:

```text
/config/custom_components/tesla_vehicle_command/
```

When installing manually, copy the contents of this repository's
`custom_components/tesla_vehicle_command/` directory into that destination.
The `brand/` and `translations/` directories are required and must be copied
with the Python modules.

Restart Home Assistant after installation or updates.

### Configure

1. Open **Settings > Devices & services > Add integration**.
2. Select **Tesla Vehicle Command**.
3. Enter the Tesla Developer App Client ID and Client Secret.
4. Complete Tesla OAuth in the browser.
5. Select the vehicle or vehicles to add.
6. Choose **Import** and paste the complete content of:

   ```text
   /config/tesla_vehicle_command/keys/tesla-command-private-key.pem
   ```

   Include both PEM delimiters. A correct key begins with `-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----` or `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` and ends with the matching five-dash `END` line.

The integration creates the following private internal proxy files automatically:

```text
/config/tesla_vehicle_command/proxy-cert.pem
/config/tesla_vehicle_command/proxy-key.pem
/config/tesla_vehicle_command/proxy-ca.pem
/config/tesla_vehicle_command/proxy-command-key.pem
```

Do not edit these generated files. The integration and local proxy use the Supervisor DNS hostname `local-tesla-vehicle-command-proxy` internally.

## 8. Pair the Existing Command Key With the Vehicle

With the vehicle online and the Tesla mobile app signed in, open:

```text
https://tesla.com/_ak/<tesla-key-hostname>.<your-domain>?vin=<vehicle-vin>
```

Approve the enrollment prompt in the Tesla mobile app. The domain in this URL must exactly match the Tesla Developer App allowed origin and the hostname serving the public PEM.

If the vehicle reports that the public key is not paired, do not generate a replacement private key. Confirm the public PEM served at the `.well-known` endpoint was derived from the same private key imported in step 7, then repeat the enrollment link with the vehicle awake and online.

## 9. Enable Fleet Telemetry

Fleet Telemetry is required for vehicle state. The receiver accepts the vehicle's mTLS stream and publishes decoded records on a private ZMQ endpoint.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The integration never calls Tesla's `vehicle_data` endpoint after setup. Entity state is restored from Home Assistant's local telemetry cache and then updated only by incoming Fleet Telemetry records. Until the receiver has delivered a field, its corresponding entity has no state.

### Dummy Example

This example uses these placeholder values. Replace them with your own public DNS hostname, forwarded TCP port, and vehicle VIN:

```text
Fleet Telemetry hostname: telemetry.example.net
Fleet Telemetry port:     4443
Vehicle VIN:              5YJ3E1EA0PF000000
```

1. Install **Tesla Fleet Telemetry Receiver** from this repository in **Settings > Add-ons > Add-on store**. Enable **Start on boot**, but do not start it yet.
2. Open **Settings > Devices & services**, select **Tesla Vehicle Command**, then select **Configure**. Enter `telemetry.example.net` as **Fleet Telemetry hostname** and `4443` as **Fleet Telemetry port**. Submit the options and reload the integration.
3. The integration generates a dedicated telemetry CA and server certificate under `/config/tesla_vehicle_command/`. These are separate from the command proxy certificates. Confirm the files exist from the Home Assistant Terminal/SSH add-on:

  ```sh
  ls -l /config/tesla_vehicle_command/telemetry-ca.pem \
    /config/tesla_vehicle_command/telemetry-cert.pem \
    /config/tesla_vehicle_command/telemetry-key.pem
  ```

4. Create a DNS record for `telemetry.example.net` in your Cloudflare zone that resolves to the public IP address for the Home Assistant network. Set the record to **DNS only** (grey cloud), then configure the router or firewall to forward public TCP port `4443` to the Home Assistant host's TCP port `4443`.

### Using an Existing Cloudflare Tunnel

Continue using the existing Cloudflare Tunnel for the public-key server in step 4. A standard Cloudflare Tunnel cannot carry the Fleet Telemetry connection: Tesla opens raw mTLS TCP and cannot run the `cloudflared` client or complete a Cloudflare Access TCP login.

For telemetry, use one of these routes:

1. **Cloudflare DNS only:** Use the DNS record and TCP port forwarding from step 4 above. This is the usual home-network setup. The telemetry hostname remains in Cloudflare DNS, but traffic does not traverse the tunnel or Cloudflare proxy.
2. **Cloudflare Spectrum:** If your Cloudflare plan includes Spectrum, create a TCP Spectrum application for `telemetry.example.net:4443` with the Tesla Fleet Telemetry Receiver as its origin. Do not add Cloudflare Access or HTTP/TLS termination in front of the receiver. Spectrum setup is account-specific and may still require the receiver origin to be reachable from Cloudflare.
3. **No inbound home-network port:** This integration cannot receive telemetry directly. Use a public receiver and an authenticated outbound bridge to Home Assistant; that bridge is not implemented in this integration.

Tesla must reach the receiver without a browser login, redirect, HTTP reverse proxy, Cloudflare Access policy, or TLS termination. The receiver validates the connection using the dedicated telemetry CA generated by this integration.

5. Start **Tesla Fleet Telemetry Receiver**. Its log should show that the receiver started successfully. The add-on publishes only TCP `4443`; its ZMQ endpoint on port `5284` is private and must not be forwarded or exposed.
6. In **Developer tools > Actions**, select `Tesla Vehicle Command: Configure Fleet Telemetry`. Enter the dummy VIN `5YJ3E1EA0PF000000` only as a format example; use your actual 17-character VIN when running the action. Run the action.
7. Check the action result and receiver logs. A successful registration allows Tesla to connect to `telemetry.example.net:4443` with the CA certificate generated in step 3. Connection and record activity should appear in the receiver log once the vehicle sends telemetry.

To change the hostname, port, or telemetry CA, update the integration options and reload the integration. Re-run `tesla_vehicle_command.configure_fleet_telemetry` for every configured VIN after any such change.

Do not reuse the command-proxy certificate for telemetry, publish the ZMQ endpoint, or place the telemetry private key in a tunnel, reverse proxy, Git repository, or support request.

## Verify the Installation

1. The proxy add-on log includes `Listening on 0.0.0.0:4443`.
2. The Fleet Telemetry Receiver add-on log shows a vehicle connection and decoded `V` records.
3. In **Settings > Devices & services**, the vehicle's **Telemetry Status** diagnostic sensor changes to `receiving`.
4. Check its `received_fields`, `processed_fields`, and `unprocessed_fields` attributes. A state sensor is populated only after its source field first arrives.
5. Test a harmless command, such as flashing lights, only after the public key is paired.

## PEM and Add-on Diagnostics

List the files used by the key server and proxy add-on:

```sh
ls -l /config/tesla_public/com.tesla.3p.public-key.pem
ls -l /config/tesla_vehicle_command
```

Confirm the local Nginx add-on returns the public PEM after it starts:

```sh
curl --fail --show-error \
  http://<home-assistant-host>:8099/.well-known/appspecific/com.tesla.3p.public-key.pem
```

Confirm the public Cloudflare hostname returns the same file. The response must be HTTP `200` and must not show a Cloudflare Access page or redirect:

```sh
curl --fail --show-error --location \
  https://<tesla-key-hostname>.<your-domain>/.well-known/appspecific/com.tesla.3p.public-key.pem
```

## Optional Proxy API Diagnostics

These examples call the internal Tesla proxy directly from a Home Assistant terminal that can reach the Supervisor network. They are useful for diagnostics; normal day-to-day control should use the Home Assistant entities and services.

Set these values in the terminal. Use a short-lived Tesla OAuth access token and do not save it in shell history, scripts, or screenshots.

```sh
PROXY_URL='https://local-tesla-vehicle-command-proxy:4443'
CA_FILE='/config/tesla_vehicle_command/proxy-ca.pem'
ACCESS_TOKEN='<Tesla OAuth access token>'
VIN='<17-character vehicle VIN>'

tesla_get() {
  curl --fail-with-body --cacert "$CA_FILE" \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
    "$PROXY_URL$1"
}

tesla_post() {
  curl --fail-with-body --cacert "$CA_FILE" \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data "$2" \
    "$PROXY_URL$1"
}
```

If the terminal does not resolve `local-tesla-vehicle-command-proxy`, run the commands from a terminal add-on on the Home Assistant host or use the proxy add-on container's Supervisor-network address. Do not expose port `4443` to make terminal access easier.

Wake an asleep vehicle. It may take up to a minute before the vehicle accepts another command:

```sh
tesla_post "/api/1/vehicles/$VIN/wake_up" '{}'
```

Lock or unlock the vehicle:

```sh
tesla_post "/api/1/vehicles/$VIN/command/door_lock" '{}'
tesla_post "/api/1/vehicles/$VIN/command/door_unlock" '{}'
```

Flash lights or honk the horn:

```sh
tesla_post "/api/1/vehicles/$VIN/command/flash_lights" '{}'
tesla_post "/api/1/vehicles/$VIN/command/honk_horn" '{}'
```

Start or stop climate conditioning:

```sh
tesla_post "/api/1/vehicles/$VIN/command/auto_conditioning_start" '{}'
tesla_post "/api/1/vehicles/$VIN/command/auto_conditioning_stop" '{}'
```

Set both cabin temperature targets in Celsius:

```sh
tesla_post "/api/1/vehicles/$VIN/command/set_temps" \
  '{"driver_temp":21,"passenger_temp":21}'
```

Start or stop charging, or set the charge limit:

```sh
tesla_post "/api/1/vehicles/$VIN/command/charge_start" '{}'
tesla_post "/api/1/vehicles/$VIN/command/charge_stop" '{}'
tesla_post "/api/1/vehicles/$VIN/command/set_charge_limit" '{"percent":80}'
```

Open the charge port, rear trunk, or front trunk:

```sh
tesla_post "/api/1/vehicles/$VIN/command/charge_port_door_open" '{}'
tesla_post "/api/1/vehicles/$VIN/command/actuate_trunk" '{"which_trunk":"rear"}'
tesla_post "/api/1/vehicles/$VIN/command/actuate_trunk" '{"which_trunk":"front"}'
```

An HTTP `408` means the vehicle is asleep or offline. An error saying that the public key is not paired means the matching public key has not yet been enrolled with the vehicle.

## Metric Units

The integration reports values in metric units:

- Distance and range: `km`
- Speed: `km/h`
- Temperature: `°C`
- Tire pressure: `bar`
- Charge power: `kW`
- Added energy: `kWh`

## Versioning

The integration version shown by Home Assistant and HACS comes from these fields:

```text
custom_components/tesla_vehicle_command/manifest.json  -> version
hacs.json      -> version and manifest.version
```

Set all three values to the GitHub release number without the `v` prefix, then publish the matching Git tag and release, such as `v0.2.7`.

The proxy and telemetry add-ons are independent and use these fields:

```text
tesla_vehicle_command_proxy/config.yaml  -> version
tesla_vehicle_command_telemetry/config.yaml  -> version
```

Increase an add-on version whenever its Docker image, startup script, or configuration changes. Add-on versions do not need to match the integration release version.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Resolution |
| --- | --- |
| `412 partner account must be registered` | Register the partner account using the correct Fleet API region and key hostname. |
| Cloudflare `524` or login page at the key URL | Fix the Tunnel origin; remove Cloudflare Access and redirects from the key hostname. |
| Proxy waits for integration files | Start or reload the integration and ensure the proxy add-on has `config:ro` mapping. |
| `invalid private key: expected PEM encoding` | Import the complete original P-256 private PEM, including both five-dash delimiter lines. |
| `certificate signed by unknown authority` from Fleet API | Rebuild the proxy add-on from this repository; its image installs `ca-certificates`. |
| `public key has not been paired with the vehicle` | Serve the public key matching the imported private key and repeat the Tesla enrollment link. |
| `408 vehicle unavailable` | The vehicle is offline or asleep. Wake it in the Tesla app and retry. |
| Proxy TLS `EOF` messages | Reload the integration and restart the proxy add-on after the integration has generated its TLS files. |
